            <h3>Welcome to the Christine Lucas Piano Studio</h3>
            <p>
                Christine Lucas is a pianist who currently wears many different musical hats: private piano teacher, music history professor, pit orchestra director, accompanist, church musician, and competition chair.
            </p>

            <p>
                Originally from Center Township in Beaver County, she studied with Marina Lupinacci throughout high school. She attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania, earning a B.A. in Music Performance. During her junior year of undergraduate studies, she also
                participated in a semester-long student exchange at the University of Zagreb (Croatia) Academy of Music. She went on to earn an M.M. in Piano Performance with an emphasis in Piano Pedagogy from Florida State University, where she held
                a group piano teaching assistantship. She opened her private piano studio in 2006. She loves teaching students of all abilities, with a wide range of musical goals. Her students particularly look forward to her themed studio recitals.
                Several of her students have gone on to major in music and/or piano.
            </p>

            <p>
                Beginning in 2012, Christine started teaching Introduction to Music as an online, 3-credit course at the Community College of Beaver County. This post allows her to share her love of classical music and history with students who may have never had any
                in-depth exposure to the genre.
            </p>

            <p>
                Christine has a great love for ensemble playing and is proud to serve as the music director for Center Theatre Players, a non-profit, community musical theater group based in Rochester, PA. Her other local performances have included PMEA choral festivals,
                the Hopewell Community Big Band, and many high school musical pit orchestras. She served as music director of St. Joseph Parish in Coraopolis from 2017-2020 and remains an active substitute organist and cantor throughout the Pittsburgh
                area.
            </p>

            <p>
                She coordinates the Lois Streator/Lois Smith Memorial Competition for the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of Pennsylvania Music Teachersâ€™ Association and is also on the board of the Steinway Society of Western Pennsylvania.

            <h3>CHRISTINE LUCAS STUDIO POLICY</h3>
            <p>Last Updated Jan. 2025</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The studio operates year-round on a month to month basis. Summer enrollment is a requirement to hold
                    your place in the studio for the fall.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tuition Rates:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="monospaced">
                            ½ hour weekly lessons ---------------- $32.00/ lesson
                        </li>
                        <li class="monospaced">
                            ¾ hour weekly lessons ---------------- $48.00/ lesson
                        </li>
                        <li class="monospaced">
                            1 hour weekly lessons ---------------- $64.00/ lesson
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Payment methods:</strong> Payment can be made via cash, check, Venmo (Christine-Lucas-805),
                    or Zelle (412-974-5584).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>If you need to cancel a lesson for any reason,</strong> you may do so through the
                    mymusicstaff Parent or
                    Student Portal. Lessons canceled up to one hour before the lesson start time will receive a make-up
                    credit. Lessons canceled with less than an hour's notice will not receive a make-up credit. You may
                    carry up to three make-up credits simultaneously. Make-up credits expire after 90 days.
                    Canceled lessons will not pro-rate the next month's tuition. Your monthly tuition secures your
                    weekly lesson day and time. I am charged rent based on the hours of teaching time that I have booked
                    at PYCO, regardless of whether I teach the lesson or not.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>If I cancel a lesson,</strong> I reserve the right to credit the student (as I'm likely
                    canceling my entire
                    teaching day, which would generate a lot of makeups). However, if you request that I give a makeup
                    credit even though I canceled, I'm happy to do so.0
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Makeup lesson times</strong> can be found on the mymusicstaff calendar. If another student
                    has canceled, you
                    can take their time slot by reserving through the mymusicstaff portal. Additionally, I try to offer
                    some Friday afternoon times each week. A few times a year, there are dedicated makeup weeks when all
                    regular lessons are canceled and students have a wide range of days and times to choose for a
                    makeup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Dedicated makeup times are booked in 15-minute increments.</strong> When scheduling makeups,
                    be sure to book
                    enough back-to-back times to cover your regular lesson time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While I do my best to help students to juggle their schedules, <strong>it is in everyone’s best
                        interest to
                        make as few changes to the schedule as possible.</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Studio families will receive an emailed invoice for the upcoming month</strong> via the
                    mymusicstaff app,
                    typically 3 days before the start of the next month. Tuition must be paid in advance before the 5th
                    of each month. Late payment of over one month will result in a late charge equaling the amount of
                    rent ($10.00/hr) that I will have paid PYCO for your student’s time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>In order to allow for a more flexible summer schedule, in May I will inform studio families
                        of a
                        minimum number of lessons which must be taken (or at least paid)</strong> in order to hold your
                    spot in the
                    studio for the fall. That number is equal to ⅔ of the number of weeks I’ve made available for
                    lessons in the months of June and August. For 2025, I will teach for 9 weeks during those months.
                    Students must pay for a minimum of 6 lessons for those months, with the option to take up to all 9
                    lessons made available to them.

                    The minimum summer tuition for 2025 is:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="monospaced">
                            ½ hour weekly lessons ---------------- $192.00
                        </li>
                        <li class="monospaced">
                            ¾ hour weekly lessons ---------------- $288.00
                        </li>
                        <li class="monospaced">
                            1 hour weekly lessons ---------------- $384.00
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    If you decide to take a break for the summer without payment, <strong><u>your time slot will be
                            given to
                            another student.</u></strong> Since many new students start lessons in the summer, I cannot
                    block a time slot and
                    not use it for several months waiting for a student to come back in the fall. It is also unfair to
                    the new student that took your spot, to be dismissed when you return in the fall. If you will be
                    away in the summer for several weeks or months, please call me to discuss options to retain your
                    student status. Many parents double up lessons before and/or after they leave, or just pay for the
                    minimum number of summer lessons and make up what they can.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>If you decide to discontinue lessons</strong>, I will refund any tuition intended for future lessons. I will
                    not refund makeup lesson credits. <strong>Any outstanding tuition balance will be due at the time of the
                    last lesson.</strong>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                You will be asked to sign a copy of this policy for my records at your first lesson.

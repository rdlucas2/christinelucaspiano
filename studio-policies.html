            <h3 id="mcetoc_1ckbm1u9l0">Practice Expectations</h3>
            <p><strong>Studying music is fun and rewarding, but only if the student invests enough time and energy
                    during home practice so that progress can be made in lessons.</strong>&nbsp;Students can get the most out of lessons if they:&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make daily practice a priority. After the first few months of study, expect daily practice to last
                    <u>at least</u> the same number of minutes as the lesson in order to achieve steady progress. If the student’s goal is to play competitively, at least twice the lesson length for daily practice is necessary.
                </li>
                <li>Consult their notebooks to make sure to prepare everything that I have assigned</li>
                <li>Give their best effort!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I realize that sometimes students' lives become very hectic and they can't give 100% preparation every single week, but they should make a habit of allotting enough practice time per week to cover all the assigned material. If something truly
                out of the ordinary comes up, parents should make me aware of it. <u><br></u></p>
            <p>Providing your child with this experience will teach him or her not only about music, but about responsibility, preparing for public presentations and performances, and goal-setting - skills that will apply to many other areas of their lives.
                <br> <br> <strong>Parents should take advantage of sitting in for lessons to learn how to help your
                    child to improve and to find out my expectations. When parents are involved, student achievement is
                    positively impacted.</strong></p>
            <h3 id="mcetoc_1ckbm79q42">Lesson Information</h3>
            <p>Typically the private lesson time is determined by two factors: the age of the student and level of the student’s playing ability. The amount of time appropriate for each student will be decided by the teacher from semester to semester.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Beginning students typically take 30-minute lessons.</li>
                <li>Intermediate students typically take 45-minute lessons.</li>
                <li>Advanced students typically take 60-minute lessons.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="mcetoc_1ckbmki7c3">Missed Lessons</h3>
            <h4>Makeup Policy</h4>
            <p>Students are expected to attend lessons each week of the semester. If you need to cancel a lesson for any reason, you may do so through the Student Portal. Lessons cancelled up to one hour before the lesson start time will receive a make-up
                credit. Lessons cancelled with less than an hour's notice will not receive a make-up credit. You may carry up to three make-up credits. Make-up credits expire after 90 days. Cancelled lessons will not pro-rate the next month's tuition.
                Your monthly tuition secures your weekly lesson day and time. I am charged rent based on the hours of teaching time that I have booked at PYCO, regardless of whether I teach the lesson or not.</p>
            <h4>School Holidays</h4>
            <p>Scheduled lessons will be held <u>regardless</u> of school holidays (such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Columbus Day) or individual districts’ break schedules.</p>
            <h4>Extreme Weather Conditions</h4>
            <p>If the student cannot attend the lesson because of extreme weather, the lesson will be taught virtually.
            </p>
            <h4 id="mcetoc_1ckbn1trl4">Lessons Cancelled by Teacher</h4>
            <p>In the event of an emergency or illness, I will provide as much advance notice as possible that lessons will be cancelled (phone calls, texts, and emails). Given that a cancellation by me often affects multiple students, this is the only circumstance
                in which I may choose to prorate/credit lessons.</p>
            <h3 id="mcetoc_1ckbn3cvu5">Probationary Lessons</h3>
            <p>In the case of very young beginners, parents and I may be waiting to see if a student is mature enough for lessons. Attention span and willingness to practice are the most common determining factors. The parent may notify me if they decide
                the student is indeed not ready for the demands of piano study. I, in turn, may also make the call that the student is not ready.&nbsp; <strong>Note: for young children, parental involvement is crucial to
                    success.</strong></p>
            <h3 id="mcetoc_1ckbn69km6">Termination of Lessons</h3>
            <p>Should the student, student’s family, or teacher decide to terminate lessons for any reason, communication is necessary and advance notice is also appreciated. After the planned final lesson occurs, the family will be issued a full refund
                of all remaining tuition and materials/contest registration fees.</p>
            <h3 id="mcetoc_1ckbnbguo7">Parent and Student Responsibilities</h3>
            <h4>Parents must:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Attend all lessons. The student, teacher, and parent work as a team!</li>
                <li>Communicate frequently with the teacher regarding practice habits and the expectations that are placed on the student.</li>
                <li>Assist in home practice if the teacher requests that parents do so. The younger the student, the more vital the parent’s role is to the success of the lessons. For young beginners, parents will be asked to replicate the lesson concepts
                    daily – just like reading and math drills for school.</li>
                <li>Assume responsibility for scheduling makeup lessons.</li>
                <li>Arrive promptly for lessons.</li>
                <li>Pay tuition and any fees by the stated deadlines.</li>
                <li>Maintain control over any tagalong siblings.</li>
                <li><strong>Always support your child’s musical endeavors!</strong> Give frequent praise and applaud your child for his or her efforts!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Students must:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrive with all music and assigned materials, including assignment notebooks.</li>
                <li>Practice as prescribed during the week as outlined in the practice notebook.</li>
                <li>Arrive with trimmed and filed fingernails (nails must be no longer than flush with the fingertip). No acrylic tips!&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Return any borrowed materials by the due date and in the same condition as they left.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="mcetoc_1ckbnd785a">Other Studio Rules / Info&nbsp;</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Students are to encouraged to enter the studio without knocking</strong> – if it is their lesson time, I am expecting them.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong>Do not bring food or drink into the studio. </strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <h5 id="mcetoc_1ckbnefouc">Tuition</h5>
            <p>Tuition is based on an hourly rate.&nbsp; Effective 11/01/20, the hourly rate is $60.00/hour.</p>
            <p>30 minutes lessons = $30.00</p>
            <p>45 minute lessons = $45.00</p>
            <p>60 minutes lessons = $60.00</p>
            <p><strong>Monthly tuition is due by the 5th of the month.&nbsp;</strong></p>
            <p>If tuition remains unpaid after 30 days, a late fee of $10 per hour of instruction received during the previous month will be added to the balance. This fee will cover the rent that I pay to PYCO. For example, if the student had a total of
                2 hours of instruction in the previous month, a late fee of $20 will be added to the outstanding balance.
            </p>
            <p>Should a student fail to return any borrowed materials or intentionally destroy any item in the studio, the student will be invoiced for the full replacement value.</p>
            <h3 id="mcetoc_1ckbnl659d">Performances</h3>
            <h4>Preparation</h4>
            <p><strong>All music MUST be memorized for studio recitals. The student must give a satisfactory performance
                    from memory by the date of the last private lesson before the event in order to be included on the
                    program.</strong></p>
            <h4>Dress Code&nbsp;</h4>
            <p><strong>Dress code for recital performers:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No sneakers or any athletic apparel (team or sporting goods logos, sweats, flip-flops, etc.)</li>
                <li>No jeans or denim clothing (including skirts and shirts)</li>
                <li>No T shirts</li>
                <li>Long hair should be secured so that it does not obscure the performer’s vision.</li>
                <li>Skirts / dresses: if you’re thinking about wearing a dress or skirt, test it out at home. Sit at the piano with it on and see where the skirt falls.&nbsp; Use common sense and/or get an opinion from a family member if you’re not sure.</li>
                <li>Girls’ shoes: heels are fine, but avoid platform shoes or shoes with thick soles – they can REALLY mess up your pedaling! Practice in the shoes that you intend to wear!</li>
            </ul>
